# PersonalPortfolio
- I Build a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a web developer.
- I Design an attractive and visually appealing layout that captures visitors' attention and I include a home page with a captivating headline, photo, and summary of my skills.
- I also provide an "About Me" section with a detailed background, education, and professional experience.
